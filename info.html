                        Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis.
                        Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a cariety of different programs and isn't spacialized for any specific problems .  
                    </p>

                    <p>Python is also a high-level, general purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. 
                        It supports multiple programming paradigms, including:-
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Structured, object-oriented and functional programming. 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Python is often used as a support language for software developers, for build control and managament, testing, and in many other ways. SCons for build control. Buildbot and Apache Gump for automated continuous compilation and testing. Roundup or Trac for bug tracking and project managment. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can create complex, multi-protocol applications while maintaining concise, readable syntax. In fact, some of the most popular applications were built with python .

                        Python has become a language of choice, not just for developers but more and more businesses are relying on it as the backbone of their operations. Just what has contributed to the uncontested rise in its popularity and what career and salary prospects can Python developers expect in the future?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Created in the 1990s by Guido van Rossum, who named it for the cult Monty Python’s Flying Circus, Python is a programming language that is relatively easy to pick up, as its syntax is straightforward and easy to read.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This can mean it’s a good choice for beginners, but experienced software pros are wise to its potential too. In fact, according to Stack Overflow’s 2023 developer survey, it’s only pipped to the post by JavaScript in terms of uptake.
                    </p>

                    <p>Just over 40% of the survey’s respondents said the latter was the most desired language, compared to 39.81% for Python. The survey also noted rising salaries, with 2022’s median yearly salary at $71,205 compared to $78,331 in 2023. In Europe, the picture looks a little different with junior developers earning up to €50,000 in Ireland, according to Morgan McKinley.

                        Glassdoor notes that in France, Python pros can earn between €40,000 and €53,000, while in Germany, you’re looking at a range between €45,000 to €80,000 per year, with the average pay packet rounding out at €62,500.

                    What are some of the projects that I can do with <em>Python</em>
                </header>
                <article>We can make simply use the libraries .
                <p>
                     For example, <code>Import Pygame, Import Ursina Engine</code>

                </p>
                <p>
                    we can also make a simple 3d and 2d games using python with the libraries available down bellow.
                    For Example:- <code>Import Ursina </code>
                    <code>Import Pygame</code>
                    This are the top two most popular libraries to make 2d and 3d games .                 
                </p>
                <header>Hello World Project</header>
                <p>Hello World Project is one of the most popular and simplest project a programmer could ever make . </p>
                <p>Here is a step on how to make a hellow world Project in Python . 
                    <code>
                        print(010101010101010101010101)
                        print(010101010101010101010101)
                        print(0101 Hello World 0101010)
                        print(010101010101010101010101)
                        print(010101010101010101010101)
                    </code>
                </p>
            <header ><a class="main-section" id="Python Variables" >Python Variables</a></header>
            <p>
                Python Variablesare like containers that hold values. They can be used to store anything from simple data types like integers and strings to more complex data structures like lists and dictionaries. 
                You can think of them as labels you attach to values to keep track of them. Here's an example:- 
                <code>
                    Type = Integer(45)
                    Type = String("DataFlair")  
                </code>
            </p>

            <header>If statement in Python. </header>
            <p>An if statement is a condition statement used to check a condition, and excute it if the condition holds true. It also a control flow statement,
            Which utilizes decision-making to control the flow of execution. Here's an example:-
            <code>number = 10
                  if number > 0:
                  # code 
                  # Put a code after if statement
            </code>
            </p>
            <header>While Statement. </header>

            <p>
                A while statement in python sets aside a block of code that is to be executed repeatedly until a condition is falsified. 
                The structure of a while loop allows the total number of iterations, or repetitions, to be unknown from the start. 
            </p>
            <code>
                error = 50.0
                #  12.5
                while error > 1:  # true
                error = error / 4
                print(error)
            </code>

            <header>What tearms you should be familiar with !</header>
            <p>Sometimes in Python you might see some signs or Quotation marks and you might be confused why they are really important . 
                For example:- '#' This sign describes that the statement is a comment not a command so its not going to apply changes or do anything to your script . 
                <code># This is a comment not a command so it won't apply anything to the website . </code>
            </p>

            <header>Function declared in Python . </header>
            <p>In Python, you define a function with the def keyword, then write the function identifier (name) followed by parentheses and colon . 
                The next thing you have to do is make sure you indent with a tab or 4 spaces, and then specify what you want the function to do for you . 
            </p>
            <code>
                def func1():
                    print("I am learning Python Function")
                func1()
                #print func1()
                #print func1
            </code>
